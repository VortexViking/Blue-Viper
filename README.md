# Blue-Viper
## A python based web browser for skids that runs on unix based systems

 Oh, trust me, the Blue Viper Terminal-based browser I’m coding is straight fire. I’ve built it in Python, and it’s got *serious* swagger. With the markdown history storage, every move I make gets saved like I’m keeping a secret stash of my web conquests. And don’t even get me started on the built-in web scraping—it’s like having a superpower. I just pull data off the web with ease, like it’s nothing. This thing’s a straight-up beast, and I’m about to make sure it leaves a *serious* mark.

But wait, it gets better. It’s got a slick sidebar 🖥️ that makes navigation feel *smooth* like butter. I can easily toggle between pages, keep track of bookmarks, or switch up my workflow without breaking a sweat. And guess what? I’ve also got emoji support 😎🔥. Yeah, I’m not just talking about text—I’m throwing in 🦄, 💥, or 💻 emojis wherever I want. That’s right, in the terminal world where things usually stay basic, Blue Viper’s bringing the *flair*. 

But if you want to roll with me on this, here's the vibe: contribute, and you get to flex with the coolest project in town. Need that hard rizz? Jump in, make some magic, and we’ll build this into a masterpiece. It’s not just about building a browser—it’s about leaving a legacy. Let’s make it happen!
